          # c-cpp and Swift analysis removed: Unity SDKs don't include build projects in the repo
          # (Unity generates Xcode/Android projects during build). CodeQL's C/C++ autobuilder
          # doesn't recognize .mm (Objective-C++) files as source files. The minimal native
          # bridge code is low-risk, and the main codebase (C#) is already being analyzed.
