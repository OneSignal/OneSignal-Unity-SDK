# Unity v5.0.0 Migration Guide
In this release, we are making a significant shift from a device-centered model to a user-centered model.  A user-centered model allows for more powerful omni-channel integrations within the OneSignal platform.

This migration guide will walk you through the Unity SDK v5.0.0 changes as a result of this shift.

# Overview

Under the user-centered model, the concept of a "player" is being replaced with three new concepts: users, subscriptions, and aliases.


## Users

A user is a new concept which is meant to represent your end-user.   A user has zero or more subscriptions and can be uniquely identified by one or more aliases.  In addition to subscriptions a user can have **data tags** which allows for user attribution.


## Subscription

A subscription refers to the method in which an end-user can receive various communications sent by OneSignal, including push notifications, in app messages, SMS, and email.  In previous versions of the OneSignal platform, this was referred to as a “player”. A subscription is in fact identical to the legacy “player” concept.  Each subscription has a **subscription_id** (previously, player_id) to uniquely identify that communication channel.


## Aliases

Aliases are a concept evolved from [external user ids](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/external-user-ids) which allows the unique identification of a user within a OneSignal application.  Aliases are a key-value pair made up of an **alias label** (the key) and an **alias id** (the value).   The **alias label** can be thought of as a consistent keyword across all users, while the **alias id** is a value specific to each user for that particular label. The combined **alias label** and **alias id** provide uniqueness to successfully identify a user.

OneSignal uses a built-in **alias label** called `external_id` which supports existing use of [external user ids](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/external-user-ids). `external_id` is also used as the identification method when a user identifies themselves to the OneSignal SDK via the `OneSignal.login` method.  Multiple aliases can be created for each user to allow for your own application's unique identifier as well as identifiers from other integrated applications.

## Code Modularization

The OneSignal SDK has been updated to be more modular in nature.  The SDK has been split into namespaces and functionality previously in the static `OneSignal.Default` class has been moved to the appropriate namespace.  The namespaces, their containing modules, and how to access them in code are as follows:

| Namespace      | C#                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------|
| User           | `OneSignal.User`           |
| Session        | `OneSignal.Session`        |
| Notifications  | `OneSignal.Notifications`  |
| Location       | `OneSignal.Location`       |
| InAppMessages  | `OneSignal.InAppMessages`  |
| LiveActivities | `OneSignal.LiveActivities` |
| Debug          | `OneSignal.Debug`          |



## Initialization

Initialization of the OneSignal SDK, although similar to past versions, has changed.  The target OneSignal application (`appId`) is now provided as part of initialization and cannot be changed post-initialization.  A typical initialization now looks similar to below

    OneSignal.Initialize(ONESIGNAL_APP_ID);
    // RequestPermissionAsync will show the native platform notification permission prompt.
    // We recommend removing the following code and instead using an In-App Message to prompt for notification permission.
    var result = await OneSignal.Notifications.RequestPermissionAsync(true);

_For iOS: Remove any usages of `setLaunchURLsInApp` as the method and functionality has been removed._

If your integration is not user-centric, there is no additional startup code required.  A user is automatically created as part of the push subscription creation, both of which are only accessible from the current device and the OneSignal dashboard.

If your integration is user-centric, or you want the ability to identify as the same user on multiple devices, the OneSignal SDK should be called once the user has been identified:

    OneSignal.Login("USER_EXTERNAL_ID");

The `login` method will associate the device’s push subscription to the user that can be identified via alias  `externalId=USER_EXTERNAL_ID`.  If a user with the provided `externalId` does not exist, one will be created.  If a user does already exist, the user will be updated to include the current device’s push subscription.  Note that a device's push subscription will always be transferred to the currently logged in user, as they represent the current owners of that push subscription.

Once (or if) the user is no longer identifiable in your app (i.e. they logged out), the OneSignal SDK should be called:

    OneSignal.Logout();

Logging out has the affect of reverting to a “device-scoped” user, which is the new owner of the device’s push subscription.


## Subscriptions

In previous versions of the SDK there was a player that could have zero or one email address, and zero or one phone number for SMS.  In the user-centered model there is a user with the current device’s **Push Subscription** along with the ability to have zero or **more** email subscriptions and zero or **more** SMS subscriptions.  A user can also have zero or more push subscriptions, one push subscription for each device the user is logged into via the OneSignal SDK.

**Push Subscription**
The current device’s push subscription can be retrieved via:

    var pushSubscription = OneSignal.User.PushSubscription;


If at any point you want the user to stop receiving push notifications on the current device (regardless of permission status) you can use the push subscription to opt out:

    pushSubscription.OptOut();


To resume receiving of push notifications (driving the native permission prompt if OS permissions are not available), you can opt back in:

    pushSubscription.OptIn();

To observe changes to the push subscription you can add a custom method to the event:
    
    OneSignal.User.PushSubscription.Changed += yourOnPushSubscriptionChangedMethod;

    public void yourOnPushSubscriptionChangedMethod(object sender, PushSubscriptionChangedEventArgs e) {
        ...
    }

**Email/SMS Subscriptions**
Email and/or SMS subscriptions can be added or removed via:

    // Add email subscription
    OneSignal.User.AddEmail("customer@company.com")
    // Remove previously added email subscription
    OneSignal.User.RemoveEmail("customer@company.com")
    
    // Add SMS subscription
    OneSignal.User.AddSms("+15558675309")
    // Remove previously added SMS subscription
    OneSignal.User.RemoveSms("+15558675309")

### Debug Namespace
The debug namespace is accessible via `OneSignal.Debug` and provides access to debug-scoped functionality.

| **C#**                | **Description**                                                                                    |

| `LogLevel LogLevel`   | *The log level the OneSignal SDK should be writing to the Unity log. Defaults to [LogLevel.Warn].* |
| `LogLevel AlertLevel` | *The log level the OneSignal SDK should be showing as a modal. Defaults to [LogLevel.None].*       |


# Limitations 
- Changing app IDs is not supported.
- Any User namespace calls must be invoked after initialization. Example: OneSignal.User.AddTag("tag", "2")
- In the SDK, the user state is only refreshed from the server when a new session is started (cold start or backgrounded for over 30 seconds) or when the user is logged in. This is by design.

# Known issues
- Identity Verification
    - We will be introducing JWT in a follow up release

# Troubleshooting
## Android
```
Assets/OneSignal/Example/OneSignalExampleBehaviou.cs: error CS0246: The type or namespace name '...' could not be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
```

```
Assets/OneSignal/Attribution/OneSignalVSAttribution.cs: error CS0117: 'OneSignal' does not contain a definition for '...'
```

1. Delete the directory at `Assets/OneSignal`
   - You can import the OneSignal assets again with our [unitypackage](https://github.com/OneSignal/OneSignal-Unity-SDK/releases) or through our [listing on the Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/add-ons/services/billing/onesignal-sdk-193316)
2. Check the menu at **Window > OneSignal SDK Setup** to see if there are any remaining steps to run
