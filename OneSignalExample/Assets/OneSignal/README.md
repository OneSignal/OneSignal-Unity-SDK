4. A prompt to import all of the files of the OneSignal Unity SDK will appear. Click **Import** to continue and compile the scripts into your project.
5. Navigate to **Window > OneSignal SDK Setup** (or follow the popup if upgrading) in the Unity Editor which will bring up a window with some final steps which need 
   to be completed in order to finalize the installation. The most important of these steps is **Import OneSignal packages**.
   
    > *Depending on your project configuration and if you are upgrading from a previous version, some of these steps may already be marked as "completed"*

## Platform Configuration
### iOS
After building in Unity and exporting the XCode project follow these steps:
1. To open your project ensure that you use the `.xcworkspace` file and not the `.xcodeproj` to open the project.
2. Click on the **Unity-iPhone** project and its similarly named target and select the **Signing & Capabilities** tab.
3. From here check **Automatically manage signing**, on the prompt click **Enable Automatic**, and select your **Team**.

    ![automatically manage signing](Documentation/ios_auto_sign.png)

4. Scroll down to **App Groups** and click on the refresh button.
    > NOTE: You may have to press this a few times as it will ask you for each signing type.

    ![refresh app groups](Documentation/ios_refresh_app_groups.png)

5. Repeat the same steps above but for the **OneSignalNotificationServiceExtension** target this time.

    ![extension signing and groups](Documentation/ios_extension_sign_and_groups.png)

6. **App Groups** should now be provisioned for you going forward for your iOS bundle id, even on clean builds.

7. Make sure all **Targets** have **Enable Bitcode** set to **No** in **Build Settings**.

### Android
1. From the Unity Editor, navigate to **Edit > Project Settings > Player** and click the **Android** settings tab.
2. Expand **Publishing Settings** and enable:
   - Custom Main Gradle Template
   - Custom Gradle Properties Template
3. Navigate to **Assets > External Dependency Manager > Android Resolver > Force Resolve** and resolve your Android dependencies.

Most of the Android setup was already handled during installation!

The only thing remaining is to setup your own notification icons. You can do this be replacing the example icons located at `Assets/Plugins/Android/OneSignalConfig.androidlib/src/main/res` 
with your own. There is a complete guide for this [in the plugin's README](com.onesignal.unity.android/Editor/OneSignalConfig.androidlib/README.md). See our 
[Customize Notification Icons](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/customize-notification-icons) page for additional details.

## Usage
You can find a complete implementation in our included [example MonoBehaviour](OneSignalExample/Assets/OneSignal/Example/OneSignalExampleBehaviour.cs). Additionally we have included a
[sample scene](OneSignalExample/Assets/OneSignal/Example/OneSignalExampleScene.unity) which you can run to test out the SDK.

### Initialization
#### Prefab
Located in the `com.onesignal.unity.core` package we've include a simple prefab which initializes OneSignal. You can easily find it using the Asset search bar
to find `OneSignalController.prefab` and making sure to select **All** or **In Packages** for your search option. Drag the prefab into your very first scene, fill
in the **App Id**, and you are immediately ready to go!

#### Code
To get started add the following code in an appropriate place such as the `Start` method of a `MonoBehaviour` early in your application's lifecycle.
```C#
// Replace 'YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID' with your OneSignal App ID from app.onesignal.com
OneSignal.Initialize("YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID");
```

You are now ready to start sending and receiving notifications and in-app messages. For additional information please see [our complete OneSignal Unity SDK docs](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/unity-sdk-setup).
