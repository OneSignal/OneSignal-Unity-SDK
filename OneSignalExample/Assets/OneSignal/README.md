## Installation
There are two methods of installation available for the OneSignal Unity SDK:
> **Upgrading from 2.13.4 or older**</br>
> It is recommended to use the **Asset Store** path for installation if you are upgrading from a version of the OneSignal Unity SDK 2.13.4 or older.

<details>
<summary><b>Unity Asset Store</b> <i>(click to expand)</i></summary>

1. Add the OneSignal Unity SDK as an available asset to your account by clicking **Add to My Assets** from [our listing on the Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/add-ons/services/billing/onesignal-sdk-193316).
2. Find the package waiting for you to download by clicking **Open in Unity** from that same page. This will open the Unity Editor and its Package Manager window.
3. On the SDK's listing in the Editor click the **Download** button. When it finishes click **Import**.

4. A prompt to import all of the files of the OneSignal Unity SDK will appear. Click **Import** to continue and compile the scripts into your project.
5. Navigate to **Window > OneSignal** (or follow the popup if upgrading) in the Unity Editor which will bring up a window with some final steps which need 
   to be completed in order to finalize the installation. The most important of these steps is **Import OneSignal packages**.
   
    > *Depending on your project configuration and if you are upgrading from a previous version, some of these steps may already be marked as "completed"*

6. After importing the packages Unity will notify you that a new registry has been added and the **OneSignal SDK Setup** window will have refreshed with a few additional 
   steps. Following these will finalize your installation of the OneSignal Unity SDK.

    Scope(s)    com.onesignal
    ```
   and click **Save**.
3. Open the **Window > Package Manager** and switch to **My Registries** via the **Packages:** dropdown menu. You will see all of the OneSignal Unity SDK packages available
   on which you can then click **Install** for the platforms you would like to include. Dependencies will be added automatically.
4. Once the packages have finished importing you will find a new menu under **Window > OneSignal**. Open it and you will find some final steps which need to be completed 
   in order to finalize the installation.

## Platform Configuration
### [iOS](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/unity-sdk-setup#step-5---ios-setup)
### [Android](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/unity-sdk-setup#step-6---android-setup)

## Usage
You can find a complete implementation in our included [example MonoBehaviour](Example/OneSignalExampleBehaviour.cs). Additionally we have included a
[sample scene](Example/Scenes/OneSignalExampleScene.unity) which you can run to test out the SDK.

### Initialization

#### Prefab
Located in the `com.onesignal.unity.core` package we've include a simple prefab which initializes OneSignal. You can easily find it using the Asset search bar
to find `OneSignalController.prefab` and making sure to select **All** or **In Packages** for your search option. Drag the prefab into your very first scene, fill 
in the **App Id**, and you are immediately ready to go!

#### Code
To get started add the following code in an appropriate place such as the `Start` method of a `MonoBehaviour` early in your application's lifecycle.
```C#
// Replace 'YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID' with your OneSignal App ID from app.onesignal.com
OneSignal.Default.Initialize("YOUR_ONESIGNAL_APP_ID");
```

You are now ready to start sending and receiving notifications and in-app messages. For additional information please see [our complete OneSignal Unity SDK docs](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/unity-sdk-setup).
